# An Alternative PointStorage

Introducing an alternative approach to storing 3D point clouds, complemented by an method for point-cloud downsampling. The Main idea is to use a tree-tree structure to facilitated optimum speed during insertion, radius or range search, at all map sizes. The algorithm is able to maintain consitent insertion times comparable to other methods and is able to optimize the search algorithm through the use of anchor points in the kd-tree. As shown below, for similar testing conditions we are able to match or surpass performance with a stronger resource constraints.

## The Storage Solution

Inspired by the incremental kd-tree (as detailed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10808)) and the Faster-LIO method ([documentation here](https://github.com/gaoxiang12/faster-lio/blob/main/doc/faster-lio.pdf)), we have developed a solution optimized for real-time applications. This approach excels in insertion, range-search, and accurate nearest-neighbor search.

Our solution enhances the incremental kd-tree by converting points into voxels. Each voxel is partitioned based on sign-cardinality and stored as octrees. This structure harnesses the speed of Faster-LIO and maintains high performance in dense map scenarios, even with over 200,000 points. Below is a performance comparison of our kd-variant (benchmarked on an i7-8750) against others (benchmarked on an Intel i7-10750H).

While this approach increases memory usage due to voxel tracking, it ensures efficient management of large-scale data. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Convert the point to a voxel.
- Check if the voxel exists or needs to be created.
- Insert the voxel into the kd-tree and update the voxel with the points in parallel.
- Each voxel is managed by a cardinal octree with careful memory management.

It is basically a kd-tree of octtrees. An added benefit of this voxel implementation is its inherent support for distribution-based searching. Each voxel can optionally track its mean or covariance incrementally. Other functions, such as nearest neighbor/range search (spherical or box), delete operations, and rebalancing, follow the same scheme as the incremental kd-tree with some modifications.

## The Downsampling Algorithm

In lidar applications, particularly for indoor solutions, filtering out crucial information in dense regions is a significant challenge. Our downsampling algorithm addresses this by maintaining distinct features, which provides a balanced basis for scan matching. Inspired by the octree downsampling scheme, our approach is as follows:

- **Segmentation:** Segment the point cloud into sign cardinality and then voxels.
- **Sorting and Selection:** Store points in each voxel by squared norm and uniformly select points after sorting.
- **Variance and Density Consideration:** Regions with high variance and density receive more representation, while sparse regions receive minimal representation. Consequently, a sparse cloud might not be downsampled depending on variance and density.

For detailed implementation, see `map_storage/sections/kd_tree/specialized.cpp`. On average, it takes 10ms to downsample ~50,000 points by half.
