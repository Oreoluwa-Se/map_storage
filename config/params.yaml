# Tree building and maintenance parameters
Build:
  max_points_in_vox: 30 # Maximum number of points stored in each level for an octant
  imbal_factor: 0.7 # Size discrepancy between left and right tree to trigger rebalancing
  del_nodes_factor: 0.5 # Maximum ratio between valid and invalid nodes before rebalancing
  track_stats: false # Track mean and covariance for each voxel. Mean is used during search, and covariance can be used as a validity check
  init_map_size: 1 # Minimum number of points to build the initial map
  voxel_size: 1.0 # Total voxel size
